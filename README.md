# Duck_explorer

## Development

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository and all its submodules

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url>
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Building the local UI

```
cd explorer-ui
npm install
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH="" npm run build
```

### Setting up CLion

**Opening project:**
Configuring CLion with the extension template requires a little work. Firstly, make sure that the DuckDB submodule is
available.
Then make sure to open `./duckdb/CMakeLists.txt` (so not the top level `CMakeLists.txt` file from this repo) as a
project in CLion.
Now to fix your project path go to
`tools->CMake->Change Project Root`([docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/change-project-root-directory.html)) to
set the project root to the root dir of this repo.

**Debugging:**
To set up debugging in CLion, there are two simple steps required. Firstly, in
`CLion -> Settings / Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deploy -> CMake` you will need to add the desired builds (e.g.
Debug, Release, RelDebug, etc). There's different ways to configure this, but the easiest is to leave all empty, except
the `build path`, which needs to be set to `../build/{build type}`. Now on a clean repository you will first need to run
`make {build type}` to initialize the CMake build directory. After running make, you will be able to (re)build from
CLion by using the build target we just created. If you use the CLion editor, you can create a CLion CMake profiles
matching the CMake variables that are described in the makefile, and then you don't need to invoke the Makefile.

The second step is to configure the unittest runner as a run/debug configuration. To do this, go to
`Run -> Edit Configurations` and click `+ -> Cmake Application`. The target and executable should be `unittest`. This
will run all the DuckDB tests. To specify only running the extension specific tests, add `--test-dir ../../.. [sql]` to
the `Program Arguments`. Note that it is recommended to use the `unittest` executable for testing/development within
CLion. The actual DuckDB CLI currently does not reliably work as a run target in CLion.

### Testing

To run the E2E test install all packages necessary:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the test suite:

```bash
pytest pytest test_http_api
```
